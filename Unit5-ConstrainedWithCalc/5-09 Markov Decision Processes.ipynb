I personally don't like over-medicating my patients (maybe this is why I'm a math teacher) so my action would be to wait a week and do nothing.\\n3. If they're still sneezing after waiting a week, my belief state would become: allergies 80%, cold 15%, <other> 5%.\\n4. They could get really insightful here. I would ask a lot of questions trying to eliminate the \\\"other\\\" hypothesis and narrow it down to cold or allergies, and then I would try to narrow it between those (is it seasonal? what seasons? do you work with small children? is your family sick?). I would try more wait time which would hopefully give a cold time to pass on, and then see if allergy meds helped. If they did, then there's the answer. If they didn't, then I would conclude that while allergies are still possible they are much less probable. At some point \\\"cold\\\" and \\\"allergies\\\" would both be so improbable I'd have to look deeper into the \\\"other\\\" option and maybe expand my state possibilities beyond three.\\n\\nYou gain a lot of insight into medicine by thinking of doctors as POMDP systems.

    "##The Premise\n",
    "Much of the time, statistics are thought of as being very deterministic, for example: \n",
    "* 79.8% of Stanford students graduate in 4 years.\n",
    "  ([www.collegeresults.org](http://www.collegeresults.org), 2014)\n",
    "  \n",
    "It's very tempting to read this sort of statistic as if graduating from Stanford in four years is a randomly determined event. In fact, it's a combination of two things:\n",
    "* random chance, which does play a role\n",
    "* the actions of the student\n",
    "\n",
    "Situations like this, in which outcomes are a combination of random chance and active choices, can still be analyzed and optimized. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can't optimize the part that happens randomly, but you can still find the best actions to take: in other words, you can optimize your actions to find the best outcome in spite of the random element.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to do this is by using a Markov Decision Process.\n",
    "\n",
    "##The Markov Property\n",
    "__Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)__ are stochastic processes that exhibit the __Markov Property__.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Recall that stochastic processes, in Unit 2, were processes that involve randomness. The examples in unit 2 were not influenced by any active choices – everything was random. This is why they could be analyzed without using MDPs.\n",
    "* The Markov Property is used to refer to situations where the probabilities of different outcomes are not dependent on past states: the current state is all you need to know. This property is sometimes called \"memorylessness.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if an unmanned aircraft is trying to remain level, all it needs to know is its current state, which might include how level it currently is, and what influences (momentum, wind, gravity) are acting upon its state of level-ness. This analysis displays the Markov Property.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, if an unmanned aircraft is trying to figure out how long until its battery dies, it would need to know not only how much charge it has now, but also how fast that charge has declined from a past state. Therefore, this does not display the Markov Property."

    "\n",
    "  One of the challenges in designing an MDP is to figure out what all the possible states are. \n",
    "\n",
    "  The current state is only one of a large set of possible states, some more desirable than others.\n",

    "\n",
    "  The current state often influences which actions are available. For example, if you are driving a car, your options for turning left or right are often restricted by what lane you are in.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* A __<font color=\"orange\">Probability Distribution</font>__ is used to determine the transition from the current state to the next state. \n",
    "\n",
    "  The probability of one state (flying sideways) leading to another (crashing horribly) is influenced by both action and chance. The same state (flying sideways) may also lead to other states (recovering, turning, landing safely) with different probabilities, which also depend on both actions and chance. \n",
    "\n",
    "  All of these different probabilities are called the probability distribution, which is often contained in a matrix.\n",

    "* <font color=\"green\">Reward</font>: calculated based on the value of the next state compared to the current state. More favorable states generate better rewards.\n",

I personally don't like over-medicating my patients (maybe this is why I'm a math teacher) so my action would be to wait a week and do nothing.\\n3. If they're still sneezing after waiting a week, my belief state would become: allergies 80%, cold 15%, <other> 5%.\\n4. They could get really insightful here. I would ask a lot of questions trying to eliminate the \\\"other\\\" hypothesis and narrow it down to cold or allergies, and then I would try to narrow it between those (is it seasonal? what seasons? do you work with small children? is your family sick?). I would try more wait time which would hopefully give a cold time to pass on, and then see if allergy meds helped. If they did, then there's the answer. If they didn't, then I would conclude that while allergies are still possible they are much less probable. At some point \\\"cold\\\" and \\\"allergies\\\" would both be so improbable I'd have to look deeper into the \\\"other\\\" option and maybe expand my state possibilities beyond three.\\n\\nYou gain a lot of insight into medicine by thinking of doctors as POMDP systems.
