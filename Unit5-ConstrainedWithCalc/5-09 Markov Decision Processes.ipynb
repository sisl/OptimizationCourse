    "##The Premise\n",
    "Much of the time, statistics are thought of as being very deterministic, for example: \n",
    "* 79.8% of Stanford students graduate in 4 years.\n",
    "  ([www.collegeresults.org](http://www.collegeresults.org), 2014)\n",
    "  \n",
    "It's very tempting to read this sort of statistic as if graduating from Stanford in four years is a randomly determined event. In fact, it's a combination of two things:\n",
    "* random chance, which does play a role\n",
    "* the actions of the student\n",
    "\n",
    "Situations like this, in which outcomes are a combination of random chance and active choices, can still be analyzed and optimized. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can't optimize the part that happens randomly, but you can still find the best actions to take: in other words, you can optimize your actions to find the best outcome in spite of the random element.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to do this is by using a Markov Decision Process.\n",
    "\n",
    "##The Markov Property\n",
    "__Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)__ are stochastic processes that exhibit the __Markov Property__.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Recall that stochastic processes, in Unit 2, were processes that involve randomness. The examples in unit 2 were not influenced by any active choices – everything was random. This is why they could be analyzed without using MDPs.\n",
    "* The Markov Property is used to refer to situations where the probabilities of different outcomes are not dependent on past states: the current state is all you need to know. This property is sometimes called \"memorylessness.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if an unmanned aircraft is trying to remain level, all it needs to know is its current state, which might include how level it currently is, and what influences (momentum, wind, gravity) are acting upon its state of level-ness. This analysis displays the Markov Property.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, if an unmanned aircraft is trying to figure out how long until its battery dies, it would need to know not only how much charge it has now, but also how fast that charge has declined from a past state. Therefore, this does not display the Markov Property."

    "\n",
    "  One of the challenges in designing an MDP is to figure out what all the possible states are. \n",
    "\n",
    "  The current state is only one of a large set of possible states, some more desirable than others.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Even though an object only has one current state, it will probably end up in a different state at some point.<br /><br />\n",
    "\n",
    "* <font color=\"red\">Action</font>: just like there is a large set of possible states, there is also a large set of possible actions that might be taken.\n",
    "\n",
    "  The current state often influences which actions are available. For example, if you are driving a car, your options for turning left or right are often restricted by what lane you are in.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* A __<font color=\"orange\">Probability Distribution</font>__ is used to determine the transition from the current state to the next state. \n",
    "\n",
    "  The probability of one state (flying sideways) leading to another (crashing horribly) is influenced by both action and chance. The same state (flying sideways) may also lead to other states (recovering, turning, landing safely) with different probabilities, which also depend on both actions and chance. \n",
    "\n",
    "  All of these different probabilities are called the probability distribution, which is often contained in a matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "* <font color=\"green\">Reward</font>: calculated based on the value of the next state compared to the current state. More favorable states generate better rewards.\n",
    "\n",
    "  For example, if a plane is flying sideways, the reward for recovering would be much higher than the reward for crashing horribly.\n",
    "\n",
    "##The Markov Decision Process\n",

    "1. The initial state is chosen randomly from the set of possible states. \n",

    "\n",
    "##POMDPs\n",
    "A variation on the traditional MDP is a __Partially Observable Markov Decision Process__ (POMDP, pronounced \"Pom D.P.\"}. In these scenarios, the system does not know exactly what state it is currently in, and therefore has to guess.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is like the difference between thinking, \n",
    "* \"I'm going in the right direction\"\n",
    "  and\n",
    "* \"I *think* I'm going in the right direction.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "POMDPs have the same elements as a traditional MDP, plus two more.\n",
    "The first is the belief state, which is the state the system believes it is in. The belief state is a probability distribution.\n",
    "For example, \n",
    "\"I think I’m going in the right direction\"\n",
    "might really mean:\n",
    "* 80% chance this is the right direction\n",
    "* 15% mostly-right direction\n",
    "* 5% completely wrong direction \n",

    "The second additional element is a set of __observations__. After the system takes an action based on its belief state, it observes what happens next and updates its belief state accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you took a right turn and didn’t see the freeway you expected, you would then change your probability distribution for whether you were going in the right direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Otherwise, a POMDP works much like a traditional MDP:\n",
    "* An action is chosen based on the belief state *(not the current state, as in a traditional MDP)*\n",
    "* The next state is reached and the reward granted\n",
    "* An observation is made and the belief state updated *(This step is absent in a traditional MDP)*\n",
