(The absolute minimum shipping cost would involve not shipping anything; you’d probably go out of business.) If you are trying to minimize your *calorie intake*, a constraint might be the fact that you have to remain healthy, which would involve minimum amounts of protein, fats, vitamins and minerals. (The absolute minimum calorie intake would be zero, resulting in death from starvation.)\n",
