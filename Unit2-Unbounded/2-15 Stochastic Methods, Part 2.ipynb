    "##Simulated Annealing\n",
    "__Simulated Annealing__ is used for functions with many local extremes. Its goal is to return the global extreme as often as possible and, if not, then another almost-as-good extreme.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Annealing* is a term used in metallurgy to describe a specific procedure in the refining of metals where the metal is heated and then slowly cooled.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the type of graph for which simulated annealing might be appropriate:\n",
    "<img src=\"files/2-15/aplstock.png\" width=400 alt=\"Apple's stock between summer 2012 and summer 2014\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "This graph has a ton of local minima and maxima. Testing points would very likely not produce a local maximum or minimum because the intervals would have to be very narrow to catch the true maximum. Sawtooth would work just as well for this particular graph, but there is no feasible version of Sawtooth for multi-variable situations. Simulated annealing can be used for any number of variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simulated annealing begins with an initial point and tests neighboring points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike traditional optimization in which the neighboring point is immediately rejected if it is \"worse\" than the original, simulated annealing will accept some \"worse\" points in the beginning in an attempt to eventually find a global extreme.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of simulated annealing in action (from Wikipedia contributer Kingpin13):\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/Hill_Climbing_with_Simulated_Annealing.gif\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "In the beginning the test line (red) is everywhere; towards the middle it's dancing mostly between the high points of the graph; nearer the end it has found the two highest points; at the very end it settles on the global maximum.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"temperature\" measure indicates the willingness of the program to accept \"worse\" answers: high at first, lower later.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's called “temperature” because the term annealing is borrowed from metallurgy where it describes a process of refinement by heating and then slowly cooling materials.\n",
    "\n",
    "In metallurgy, the slower the rate of cooling the better the refining process works, so ideally you would want the temperature to remain high for a while as it goes through a nice, slow decrease. The same thing happens here: the temperature should remain high in the beginning so the function gets to test a lot of points (being very willing to accept \"worse\" solutions); then as time goes by it will gradually become less willing to do so, eventually settling in on the optimum (or close to it). \n",
    "\n",
    "If the algorithm for simulated annealing is run for long enough, it will always find the global extreme. However, it can sometimes be prohibitive to run that many calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the advantages of simulated annealing is that even if you stop it a little early, its current solution will either be the optimum or really close to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "###Pseudocode for Simulated Annealing\n",
    "Here is a section of *pseudocode* (again from Wikipedia) showing the simulated annealing procedure for minimization:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "s ← s0; e ← E(s)                        // Initial state energy.\n",
    "sbest ← s; ebest ← e                    // Initial \"best\" solution\n",
    "k ← 0                                    // Energy evaluation count.\n",
    "while k < kmax and e > emax              // While time left & not good enough:\n",
    "    T ← temperature(k/kmax)              // Temperature calculation.\n",
    "    snew ← neighbour(s)                  // Pick some neighbour.\n",
    "    enew ← E(snew)                       // Compute its energy.\n",
    "    if P(e enew T) > random() then        // Should we move to it?\n",
    "        s ← snew; e ← enew              // Yes change state.\n",
    "    if enew < ebest then                  // Is this a new best?\n",
    "        sbest ← snew; ebest ← enew       // Save 'new neighbour' to 'best found'.\n",
    "    k ← k + 1                            // One more evaluation done\n",
    "return sbest                              // Return the best solution found.\n",
    "```\n",
    "This pseudocode (literally \"fake code\") is meant to be easily readable by people.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice:\n",
    "* the random number generator in there. That's what makes this a stochastic process. \n",
    "* the heavy documentation which makes sense of everything even though it's written in pseudocode and not in our language.\n",
    "* the iteration counter which allows us to limit the number of iterations at will.\n",
    "* the temperature counter. As `k` increases `k/kmax` changes then `T` will change (lower according to the procedure) as calculated by the unspecified function `temperature(x)`. This `T` then gets plugged into `P` later. \n",
    "* `P` is also an unspecified function, but according to the procedure, `P` will control the shifting so that as temperature increases the probability of accepting a lower value will decrease. This `P` value will still be checked against a random number, so a lower `P` does not necessarily guarantee a lack of motion, just a lower probability of it.\n",
    "* `e`, the \"energy,\" is the objective function the goal being to minimize the energy of the state; again borrowed from metallurgy. The `e > emax` in the while loop allows an upper bound to acceptable returns such that even if the iterations run out if your energy is still higher than is acceptable the loop will continue to run.\n",
